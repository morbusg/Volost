Volost -- a simple, possibly broken, forum software rushed out for its release

Features:
  Uses emerging new web-technologies such as HTML5, CSS3 and SVG.
  As such, doesn't really fit for general use without modifications.

Requirements:
  Rails >= 2.3.2 requirements (http://rubyonrails.org/download)
  attachment_fu requirements (ImageScience | Rmagick |Â MiniMagick | CoreImage)
  
  Rest of the requirements are defined as gem dependencies in environment.rb,
  and can be installed with # rake gems:install
  (with sudo possibly prepended)

Configuration:
  See config/environment.rb

TODO:
  - separate functionality from content properly
  - proper caching logic
  - make proper use of authlogic
  - tons of other stuff which I can't remember right now
